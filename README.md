### 2018 update
In my master thesis (Growing secure P2P networks), I wrote the following:
> There is always the theoretical possibility that Facebook will collaborate with the legislation and government [...]


Maybe I didn't highlight that point enough. In hindsight, following the US
PRISM spying scandal, Facebook (and any other company or government entity)
simply can't be trusted. This plugin is interested as a proof of concept, but
shouldn't really be used.
